## Procedure

Before opening an issue:

- Try to reproduce any bugs — sometimes weird stuff happens once and never again.
- Look through existing issues to see if someone else has already reported the same thing.
- Check the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/freeopensourcegames/saga-of-the-viking-seafarer/pulls) — a fix or feature might already be in the works.
- If you're suggesting a new feature or game mechanic, make sure it hasn’t been proposed already.

Before opening a pull request:

- Double-check the codebase to ensure your change doesn’t already exist (sometimes a feature is halfway implemented but not visible yet).
- Take a quick look at open PRs — someone might already be working on the same idea.
- If your work is related to an open issue, mention it in the PR description using `Closes #issue-number`.

And remember: if you're unsure whether something is worth opening a PR for, just ask in [Discussions](https://github.com/freeopensourcegames/saga-of-the-viking-seafarer/discussions) or open a draft PR — we’re friendly!

## Requirements

If the project maintainer has any additional requirements, you will find them listed here.

- **We follow coding Standards**
    - PHP:  [PSR Coding Standards](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/)

- **Follow the project code style**

- **All tests are green**

- **Add tests! (code changes only)** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, you can [squash them](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting, otherwise we will do during the merge.

## Etiquette

This project is open source and community-driven. That means the maintainers and contributors are all giving their time and energy freely to build something awesome together. We’re all here because we’re passionate — about games, storytelling, code, or just cool Viking stuff.

Please be thoughtful, patient, and kind when opening issues, suggesting features, or submitting pull requests. We’re early in development, and that’s when collaboration matters most.

Remember:
- Everyone brings different strengths, whether it's writing, coding, designing, or brainstorming.
- Not every idea or submission will make it into the game, but every contribution helps shape the project.
- Feedback is part of building something great — don’t be discouraged if we ask for changes or choose a different direction.

Let’s build something legendary, and treat each other like the crew of a longship: with trust, respect, and the shared goal of reaching new shores.
