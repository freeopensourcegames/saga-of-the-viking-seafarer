# Documentation - Saga of the Viking Seafarer

## General

*Saga of the Viking Seafarer* is an online role-playing game starting in chapter 1 on the mysterious "Dune Island," inspired by the German island of Amrum. The island serves as a strategic stop for the Vikings on their journeys to Ireland and is situated near the Eider and Treene rivers, crucial for trading goods with the prominent settlement of Hedeby. The north of the island features a Viking village, bustling with activity and preparation for journeys.

The adventure begins as the main character awakes in the fishing village of Stoneholm (Steenodde), located in the southeast of the island. The character has no recollection of past events and is found by a kind fisherman who rescued him from the sea and offered shelter until recovery. As the story unfolds, players enjoy the freedom to chart their own course in this intricate world filled with quests and alliances.

Choices abound whether to engage with fellow inhabitants, take on main quests, or embark on numerous side quests. Collaborations or tensions with various groups within the world can influence outcomes and relationships. Players may choose the path of a hero, fighting for justice, or explore the darker side, exploiting resources and arcane knowledge. Notably, main quests can be achieved through peaceful strategies, avoiding combat altogether, such as learning mystical arts or crafting potent brews. Players may also explore sinister paths, eventually obtaining the rune of power from the evil wizard, serving as a pivotal turning point in Chapter 1.

## Chapters

Currently, our focus is on the implementation of Chapter One, while keeping ideas for subsequent chapters in mind for continuous narrative development.

### Chapter 1

The protagonist awakens in Stoneholm, amidst the gentle community of fishermen on "Dune Island." Extracted from the sea by a gracious local, with no recollection of his identity, the main character begins exploration, eager to uncover the island's secrets.

The island offers diverse communities and interactions, including:

- **Stoneholm**: Fishermen's village where the journey begins.
- **Militia Camp**: Located north of Stoneholm, housing the island's defenders.
- **Fogbury**: Central village notable for its bustling marketplace, wealthy merchants.
- **Monastery of the Water Mages**: Next to Fogbury, always one mage on the marketplace and one at the church.
- **Large Farmers**: Cultivate lands in the island's northern expanse.
- **Monastery of the Fire Mages**: This mystical sanctuary lies in the island's southern reaches.
- **Southforge**: A village for skilled craftsmen along the island's southern perimeter.
- **Bonedune**: The hunters roam the island's expansive dunes, seeking bounty. Have their houses in the dunes in the north.
- **Beachrobbers**: Reside in makeshift shelters assembled from seaside flotsam.
- **Northhaven**: Viking stronghold encircled by stone, earth, and wooden defenses.
- **Lokinax Tower (Evil Wizard's Tower)**: Looms on an isolated dune, serving as the final challenge.

The anticipation builds as the hero seeks acceptance into the Viking fold, ultimately boarding their revered vessels. To achieve this, he must confront the evil wizard, seizing the coveted magical rune essential for integration into Viking society.

### Chapter 2

As development primarily focuses on Chapter 1, preliminary planning for Chapter 2 ensures coherence and longevity in storytelling. The plot extends as the character earns passage aboard Viking ships, embarking on maritime adventures to nearby islands. Handfuls of quests introduced in earlier stages foreshadow the discoveries in chapters to come, including voyages to Hedeby (pending a fantasy name) and onward to the rich historical tapestry of Ireland (pending a fantasy name) via the Normandy (pending a fantasy name) and England (pending a fantasy name), with future considerations for Icelandic (pending a fantasy name) expeditions.
